		<div class="benefits adjust">
			<h3>Speed and Bandwidth</h3>
			<p>LiFi can deliver multiple Gbps speeds in mobile devices. This next generation technology will drive wireless beyond any current capability, opening up unprecedented bandwidth.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="benefits">
			<h3>Reliability</h3>
			<p>LiFi provides enhanced reliability enabling interference-free communications and  1000 times the data density, dramatically improving the user experience.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="benefits">
			<h3>Low Latency</h3>
			<p> LiFi currently offers latency by a factor of three times lower than Wi-Fi and can radically enable innovation, automation, and applications such as AR and VR.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="benefits adjust">
			<h3>Security</h3>
			<p>Light can be contained, and secured in a physical space. LiFi enables additional control  as LiFi offers precise localisation for asset tracking and  user authentication.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="benefits">
			<h3>Interference Free</h3>
			<p>RF is vulnerable to interference from a wide range of devices such as cordless phones, microwaves and neighbouring Wi-Fi networks. LiFi signals can be defined by the area of illumination, which means interference is much simpler to avoid and even stop altogether. This also means LiFi can be used in RF hostile zones such as hospitals, power plants and aeroplanes.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="benefits">
			<h3>Localisation</h3>
			<p>LiFi is fully networked, and each LiFi enabled light has it a unique IP address which means advanced geofencing can be deployed simply in a LiFi network.</p>
