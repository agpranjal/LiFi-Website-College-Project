		<h3>What Is Li-Fi?</h3>
		<p>Imagine a world where every one of the billions of light bulbs in use today is a wireless hotspot delivering connectivity at speeds that can only be dreamed of with Wi-Fi.</p>

		<p>LiFi technology for “Light Fidelity” is a new method to connect wirelessly mobile devices and other connected devices using LED lights.</p>

		<p>LightNet used a Li-Fi-enabled lightbulb to transmit data at speeds as fast as 50 megabits per second (Mbps), which is about 10 times faster than current Wi-Fi technology. Laboratory tests have shown theoretical speeds of 224 Gigabit per second (Gbps), meaning a high-definition film could be downloaded within seconds.</p>

		<p>The progressive replacement of the 14 billion light points in the world by LEDs makes LiFi a strong candidate to become the 3rd generation communication network (after the wired network and the radio network) and potentially the densest.</p>

		<p>The technology has become an international standard for wireless communication in its first version in November 2011 by the International Telecommunications Standardisation Committee.</p>

		<h3>How Lifi Works?</h3>
		
		<p>Li-Fi is a Visible Light Communications (VLC) system for data transmission. A simple VLC system has two qualifying components: 1) at least one device with a photodiode able to receive light signals and 2) a light source equipped with a signal processing unit.</p>

		<p>A VLC light source could comprise of a fluorescent or light emitting diode (LED) bulb. Since a robust Li-Fi system requires extremely high rates of light output, LED bulbs are most ideal for implementing Li-Fi. LED is a semiconductor light source, which implies that LED light bulbs can amplify light intensity and switch rapidly. Therefore, LED cells can modulate thousands of signals without the human eye ever noticing. In turn, the changes in light intensity from the LED light source are interpreted and converted as electrical current by the receiving photodiode device. Once the electronic signal is demodulated, it is converted into a continuous stream of binary data comprising of audio, video, web, and application information to be consumed by any Internet-enabled device.</p>
